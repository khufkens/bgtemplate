# bgtemplate <a href=''><img src='https://bluegreenlabs.org/img/logo.png' align="right" height="134.5" /></a>

bgtemplate provides a custom pkgdown template for BlueGreen Labs packages. Please don’t use it for your own package. This theme was inspired by inspired by [tidytemplate](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidytemplate/) and [rotemplate](https://github.com/ropensci-org/rotemplate/).

## How to use `bgtemplate`

```r
template <- list(package = "bgtemplate")
pkgdown::build_site(devel = FALSE, override = list(template = template))
```

Everything else can be configured as usual via the `_pkgdown.yml` file as described in the pkgdown documentation.

Alternatively, set the template in _pkgdown.yml.

```yaml
template:
  package: bgtemplate
```

### Mathjax

if you want to use Mathjax you'll need to specify it in the `pkgdown` config file like so:

```yaml
template:
  params:
    mathjax: true
```
